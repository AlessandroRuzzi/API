# API Project
:small_blue_diamond: This is my proposed solution for the final assignment of the API (Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica) course that get the max score.

# Description
![alt text](Docs/social-network.jpg?raw=true)
<br/>
:small_blue_diamond: The aim of the project is to implement a simple system for monitoring relationships between entities. The program must be implemented in C11, using only the standard library (libc) and the base runtime.<br/>

The program that implements the system will receive an input of the relations from stdin and will print the report on stdout.<br/>

The project assignment PDF (in Italian) can be found [here](Docs/ProvaFinale2019.pdf).<br/>



# How it Works

There are 5 types of functions:
1. Addent<br/>
2. Addrel<br/>
3. Delrel <br/>
4. Delent <br/>
5. Report <br/>

### 1. Addent:walking:
<br/>
:small_blue_diamond:adds an entity identified by "id_ent" to the set of monitored entities; if the entity is already monitored, it does nothing<br/><br/>

### 2. Addrel:couple:

### 3. Delrel:put_litter_in_its_place:

### 4. Delent:no_pedestrians:

### 5. Report:earth_africa:
